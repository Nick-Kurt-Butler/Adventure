compile and run the file with ./run if on linux or mac and you have
a GNU g++ compiler.  If on windows and have a GNU g++ compiler look
at run file and see compilation instruction.

This program is run through Adventure.cpp as the main file.
The player's actions in any given location in the game are determined
by the logic.cpp file which Game.cpp calls.  Game.h is the main class
that controls the flow of the game.  Furthermore there is a class Player.h
in which holds a pointer to the players inventory and control the stats of
the player.  The Map.h contains a graph data structure that connects each
of the locations called Rooms in the Map class.  

The fastest solution to the game can be found in the file SOLUTION, but only
a fool would look at the SOLUTION page instead of enjoying the game.
